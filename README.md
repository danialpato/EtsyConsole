API Testing Policy
Developers test their Etsy API applications on production. However, some testing activity looks very similar to fraud. Our testing policy is designed to help you test your app while protecting our marketplace from abusive behavior.

This policy is part of our Terms of Use. By testing the API, youâ€™re agreeing to this policy, the API Terms of Use, and Etsy's Terms of Use.

By testing your application on production, you agree that you will:

Enable Developer Mode for your shop. This will further reduce the chance that a buyer will accidentally find and buy your test listings.
Create listings in draft state when possible. This removes the need to deactivate them later and also helps you avoid listing fees.
Use low prices (< $1) when creating test listings. After you have finished testing, you must deactivate the listings.
Be responsible for any fees associated with your account, even when testing, which will appear on your normal payments account for the API. This may include listing and transaction fees.
Include "test" in your shop name if your shop is being used exclusively for testing. Otherwise, please add "test" to the title or description of any listings created for testing purposes.
Not use stock images in your shop when testing. Doing so will increase the odds of your testing activity being flagged as fraud.
Cancel any transactions if a buyer accidentally purchases your test listings. Contact Etsy Support if you have any trouble doing so. Failure to fulfill or cancel the order will result in suspension of your account.
If you have any questions about how to test the API, please contact Etsy's Developer Support at developer@etsy.com.
